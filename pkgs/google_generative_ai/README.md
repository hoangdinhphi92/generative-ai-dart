# [Deprecated] Google AI Dart SDK for the Gemini API

With Gemini 2.0, we took the chance to create a unified SDK for mobile
developers who want to use Google's GenAI models (Gemini, Veo, Imagen, etc). As
part of that process, we took all of the feedback from this SDK and what
developers like about other SDKs in the ecosystem to directly work with the
[Firebase SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/vertex-ai). We don't plan to add
anything to this SDK or make any further changes. We know how disruptive an SDK
change can be and don't take this change lightly, but our goal is to create an
extremely simple and clear path for developers to build with our models so it
felt necessary to make this change.

Thank you for building with Gemini and
[let us know](https://discuss.ai.google.dev/c/gemini-api/4) if you need any
help!
